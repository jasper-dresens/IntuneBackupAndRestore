## [3.1.0] - 2021-08-12
- Microsoft has started to encrypt Custom OMA-URI values in Device Configuration profiles. Because encrypted values are now stored in newer backups, restoration fails. This update decrypts those values prior to backing up the profile, enabling restoration again.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-06-17

- Added support for backing up and restoring Settings Catalog assignments.
- Updated backup and restore output using a [PSCustomObject].
- Updated JSON depth across all functions for uniformity and to prevent (future) issues depending on the data that is being backed up/restored.

- Fixed an issue that would backup non-configured apps. (#38)
